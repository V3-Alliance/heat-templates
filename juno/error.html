<h1>The Error Page</h1>

<h2>The page you requested is not found!</h2>

<p>This is a sample error page to be used with the Swift sample template - or the S3 sample template.</p>

<p>Currently the error page is not shown unless it is directly requested. So the Swift Heat resources
do not quite work as expected.</p>

<p><b>If you forget to remove it from the Swift container, the stack will not delete successfully!</b></p>

<p>An error will be reported. You will have to manually delete the containers contents before the stack
    will be allowed to delete successfully.</p>
